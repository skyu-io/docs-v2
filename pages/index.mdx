### Manage Multiple Environments

Separate environments for development, staging, UAT and production (etc) can be easily created and managed with appropriate configurations.

Having a consistent process to create and manage the many environments (development, staging, test, UAT, production, etc) that your development teams depend on is key to achieving stable and high-velocity release cycles.

Create and manage environments in multiple configurations and provides your teams with the tools to easily deploy, manage and monitor workloads on your Infrastructure

- #### Create multiple environments on the same Cluster.
  
    SkyU configures the namespacing and other underlying network and security policies to achieve optimal isolation between your different environments.


- ####  Create environments that span across different Clusters.
  
    Create Multi-Cluster environments that are synchronized across any number of Clusters in your project. Multi-cluster environments provide a cookie-cutter approach to building highly resilient, disaster-recoverable systems with ease.

- #### Restrict permissions and access to environments
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration


- #### Promote applications between environments
  
    Promote containers between environments with a single-click (manual approval) or enable continuous deployment pipelines that makes use of advanced deployment strategies such as blue/green and canary releases with a few clicks.


- #### Environment-level audit logs and metrics
  
    Every change to made to an environment is logged and audited so you're always on top of your application infrastructure. Easily Monitor application metrics that span multiple clusters (multi-cluster environments).

### Native Kubernetes Support
Provider-agnostic connectivity to any Kubernetes Cluster whether its public, private, on-premise or on your laptop.

 


### Multi Cluster and Multi Cloud Support

>  Synchronize environments and applications between multiple Kubernetes clusters to create highly-resilient systems.

SkyU breaks-out your application layer from any and all underlying provider/vendor specific lock-ins  allowing you to migrate entire workloads and environments between different clusters with a few clicks of a button.

### Centralized Configuration

Easily create, version and apply any kind of configuration (config files, service accounts, .env files, etc) or sensitive secrets to your applications.

SkyU utilizes AWS Secret Manager to encrypt and securely store your sensitive credentials/secrets and injects/mounts them into your applications. But depending on your compliance requirements you can always 'Bring your own Vault' and plug it in.


### Industry-strength Integrations
Integrations to support any developer experience you need.
