# Cluster

SkyU Console allows you to connect to an existing Kubernetes Cluster. This works by installing the SkyU Agent on the Kubernetes Cluster. The SkyU Agent is a lightweight agent that runs on the Kubernetes Cluster and communicates with the SkyU Console. The agent is responsible for syncing the Kubernetes Cluster state with the SkyU Console.

Read more about the [SkyU Cluster Agent](/docs/concepts/cluster-connection).

## Connecting a Kubernetes Cluster

To connect a Kubernetes Cluster to SkyU, follow these steps:

<Steps>

###  Navigate to the `Clusters`.
Navigate to the `Clusters` section in the SkyU Console on the left-hand side menu. and Click on the `Add Cluster` button.

### Fill Cluster Details


Fill the following details with appropriate information.

| Field       | Description                                                                                                  | Example                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Name        | Name of the Cluster. Enter the same cluster name as it appears on AWS / Google / Azure if it's in the cloud. | docker-desktop                            |
| Description | Provide a meaningful description  for your cluster                                                           | this cluster is created for test purposes |


### Select Cluster Provider

Currently, SkyU asks you to select the cloud provider where your cluster is hosted. We support the following providers:
- **AWS** : EKS Clusters
- **Other** : GKE, AKS, Digital Ocean, Linode, etc.
- **Local** : Minikube, Docker Desktop, etc.

#### AWS EKS 
If you are connecting an AWS EKS Cluster, you need to provide the following permissions to SkyU to manage the cluster.

We require this so we can easily connect to cloud watch logs and metrics, and also to manage the cluster.

| Field               | Description                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Region              | The region where your EKS cluster is hosted.  |
| Provider Credential | The AWS credential to access the EKS cluster. |

To add a Cloud provider credential, please refer to the [AWS EKS Connect](/docs/integrations/amazon-eks) for more information.


### Select Environments

Attach the cluster to the environments you want to manage with SkyU. You can attach the cluster to multiple environments.
You can also attach the cluster to environments later.

You can read more about [Environments and Kubernetes Clusters](/docs/concepts/heirachy) in the concepts section.

 


### Connect Command

Now the Cluster has been registered with SkyU. You can now connect the cluster to SkyU by running the command provided in the console.

<Image src="/assets/images/clusters/create-command.png"   width={1000} height={500}  />

When you run the command, the SkyU Agent will be installed on the cluster. The agent will sync the cluster state with the SkyU Console.

<Callout type="info">
Please ensure that you have kubectl access to the cluster before running the command.
</Callout>



</Steps>


## Image Resgitry Whitelisting

For SkyU Agent to communicate with the SkyU Console, you need to whitelist the following domains in your firewall or network settings.



- `*.skyu.io`
- `gcr.io`
- `public.ecr.aws`
- `docker.io`

 You can read more about the [SkyU Agent](/docs/concepts/cluster-agent) in the concepts section.
