# Agent Configuration

SkyU Agent is a lightweight agent that runs on the Kubernetes Cluster and communicates with the SkyU Console. The agent is responsible for syncing the Kubernetes Cluster state with the SkyU Console.

Read more about the [SkyU Cluster Agent](/docs/concepts/cluster-agent).

## Updating the Agent

SkyU will automatically show a notification in the SkyU Console when a new agent version is available. You can update the agent by clicking on the `Update` button.

The agent will be updated to the latest version.

<Callout type="info">
The agent will be restarted after the update. The agent will not be unavailable during the update process, but it will take few minutes to sync the cluster state with the SkyU Console.
</Callout>


## Change Agent Configuration

The agent configuration can be changed by going into the `Agent` section within a Cluster in the SkyU Console.

You can change the following configurations:

| Field    | Description                                      | Default Value |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Replicas | Number of agent replicas running on the cluster. | 2             |
| CPU      | CPU limit and request for the agent.             | 400m          |
| Memory   | Memory limit and request for the agent.          | 450Mi         |


You can change the default values to suit your requirements.

## Check Agent Logs

You can check the logs of the agent from the SkyU Console. Simply navigate to the `Agent` section within a Cluster and hover over the agent pod. Click on the `Logs` button to view the logs of the agent.

Look for any errors in the logs and troubleshoot accordingly.
