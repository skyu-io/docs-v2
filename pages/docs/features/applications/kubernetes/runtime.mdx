### AI based Log Analysis

AI based log analysis has 2 main sections:

- **Debug with AIs**: This functionality enables you to let the AI analyze the logs and provide you with the most probable root cause of the issue.

- **Fix with AI**: This functionality enables you to let the AI analyze the logs, events and source code and provide a PR with the fix for the issue.
