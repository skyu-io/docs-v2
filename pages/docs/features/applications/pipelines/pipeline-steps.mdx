# Pipeline Steps

SkyU Pipelines have a few default steps that are executed in the pipeline. You can configure the build variables for those steps in this section.

## Code Scan

Code scanning is a feature that scans your code for security vulnerabilities, bugs, and other issues. You can use code scanning to identify and fix security vulnerabilities and other issues in your code before they become a problem.

By default, SkyU uses Semgrep for code scanning. Semgrep is a lightweight static analysis tool that can scan your code for security vulnerabilities, bugs, and other issues. You can configure Semgrep to scan your code for specific issues and provide detailed reports.

| Field                    | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Code Scan Configs.path` | The path where your source code is available. This is usually the src folder |


## Build and Push

### Trivy Scan

Trivy is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers. It can scan container images for vulnerabilities and provide a detailed report. You can use Trivy to scan your container images for vulnerabilities and take necessary actions to fix them.

Image build also happens in the Trivy scan step. The image is built and scanned for vulnerabilities.

| `Rule Env Vars.Rule Value` | Override value of the values.yaml This would probably be your commitID | `$COMMIT_ID`       |

In Helm Trigger pipelines, you can override the values.yaml file with the values that you want to use for the deployment. You can define the key and value that you want to override in the Rule Env Vars section. You can use any environment variable that is available in the pipeline configuration. Simply put `${env.VARIABLE_NAME}` in the value field.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I add .npmrc file to a lambda build?

In the Deploy Lambda from Zip step, you sometimes need .npmrc file to authenticate with the npm registry. You can create the .npmrc file in the pipeline using the following command in `installDepsCommand` field.

if you want to add lines to the .npmrc file, like the following:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=********
@skyu-io:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

you can use the following command in the `installDepsCommand` field.

```
echo "//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN}" > .npmrc && echo "@skyu-io:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com" >> .npmrc && yarn install
```

Please note that the `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` is an environment variable that you need to set in the pipeline configuration. You can set the environment variable in the `Environment Variables` section in the pipeline configuration.


#### I have a private npm package that I want to use in the docker build. How do I authenticate with the npm registry?

In your Dockerfile you need to add the following lines to authenticate with the npm registry.

```
ARG NPM_AUTH_TOKEN
RUN echo "//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN}" > .npmrc && echo "@skyu-io:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com" >> .npmrc
```

You can set the `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` as a build argument in the Dockerfile. You can set the build argument in the `dockerBuildArgs` field in the `Build and Push` step in the pipeline configuration.
