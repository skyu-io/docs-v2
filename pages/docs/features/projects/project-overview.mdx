| Create an Environment       | This will be ticked automatically if you select default environments to be created at Project Creation. Else you will be routed for environments to create an Environment. You can learn more about this in the [Environments](/concepts/web-applications)                                                                                                                                            |
| Enable Web Applications     | This is a feature where SkyU enables you to deploy SPA Web Applications to an S3 bucket. This requires an AWS account to be linked to the project. You can learn more about this in the [Web Applications](/concepts/web-applications) section.                                                                     |
| Create or Connect a Cluster | This is a feature where you can create a new Kubernetes Cluster or connect an existing Kubernetes Cluster to the project. You can learn more about this in the [Kubernetes Clusters](/docs/clusters/connect-cluster) section.                                                                                        |
| Configure Infrastructure    | This is a feature where SkyU enables you to deploy infrastructure through pre built templates. For this, you need to link another github repository to your project to store the infrastructure templates. You can learn more about this in the [Infrastructure as Code](/docs/infrastructure/iac-introduction) section. |
| Create an Application       | This is a feature where you can create a new application in the project. You can learn more about this in the [Applications](/concepts/applications) section.                                                                                                                                                       |
