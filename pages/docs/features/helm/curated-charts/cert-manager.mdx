# Cert Manager

Cert Manager is a Kubernetes add-on to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates from various issuing sources. It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date, and attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.



## Post Installation

You have to create a ClusterIssuer to issue certificates. You can create a ClusterIssuer by following the steps below:

Go to CRD section inside the Cert Manager application and click on `Create` button.

in the create section, enter the name as `letsencrypt-clusterissuer-prod` and add the following yaml

Please replace the following values in the yaml:

| Value         | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| email         | Your email address                                                                                                |
| ingress.class | The ingress class that the ingress controller is using. You can find this by running `kubectl get ingressclasses` |

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    # Email address used for ACME registration
    email: your-email@example.com
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      # Secret to store the ACME account private key
      name: letsencrypt-prod-account-key
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx # This is the ingress class that the ingress controller is using You can find this by running `kubectl get ingressclasses`
```



You can create any number of ClusterIssuers based on your requirements. For more information on how to create a ClusterIssuer, you can refer to the [Cert Manager Documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/).
