## Create Docker Registry Credential


<Steps>

### Navigate to Project Settings
To initiate linking Docker integrations with your project, first, select a project within your organization. Navigate to `Settings` -> `Integrations` ->`Image Registries` to view all existing image registry credentials.

<Image src="/assets/images/tutorials/image-registry/docker-registry/selection.png" alt="Hello" width={1000} height={500}  />

 

Click on `+ Integration` to introduce a new Docker Image Registry credential into your project.

### Add Credential
When linking a Docker Image Registry resource, you are required to provide the following details:

</Steps>



## 01 - Add Credential


> NOTE<br/>
> For the Registry URL, adhere to the format docker.io/username, where username is the username associated with your Docker account. Ensure `not` to append a `/` at the end of the URL.

Finally select `Create` button to save the credential.

## 02 - Edit Credential

Any Docker Image Registry credential you've added can be modified later through the image registries list page.
