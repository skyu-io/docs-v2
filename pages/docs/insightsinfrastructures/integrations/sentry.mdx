# Sentry

Sentry is an open-source error tracking tool that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time. Sentry provides a platform for monitoring and fixing application crashes and errors. It provides a real-time view of errors and crashes in your application, and allows you to fix them as they occur. 

SkyU supports Sentry to provide you API insights and error tracking for your projects. This guide will walk you through the process of linking your Sentry to your SkyU project.

## Create Sentry Credential

Click on `+ Integration` to introduce a new Sentry credential into your project.
