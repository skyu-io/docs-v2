# Docker Registry

Docker Image Registry is a service that stores and manages Docker images for your organization. It allows you to push and pull images from the registry to your local machine or cloud environment. SkyU supports linking Docker Image Registry credentials to your project to enable seamless integration with your CI/CD pipelines.

## Create Docker Registry Credential


<Steps>

### Navigate to Project Settings
To initiate linking Docker integrations with your project, first, select a project within your organization. Navigate to `Settings` -> `Integrations` ->`Image Registries` to view all existing image registry credentials.

<Image src="/assets/images/tutorials/image-registry/docker-registry/selection.png" alt="Hello" width={1000} height={500}  />


 

Click on `+ Integration` to introduce a new Docker Image Registry credential into your project.

### Add Credential
When linking a Docker Image Registry resource, you are required to provide the following details:

<Image src="/assets/images/tutorials/image-registry/docker-registry/add-docker-cred.png" alt="Hello" width={1000} height={500}  />

<Callout type="info">
For the Registry URL, adhere to the format `docker.io/username`, where username is the username associated with your Docker account. Ensure `not` to append a `/` at the end of the URL.
</Callout>

## Update Credential

Any Docker Image Registry credential you've added can be modified later through the image registries list page.

## ImagePullSecret Lifecycle in Kubernetes

Once you've linked a Docker Image Registry credential to your project, SkyU automatically creates a Kubernetes Secret for the credential. This secret is used to pull images from the registry to your Kubernetes cluster.
