# Create an Incoming Webhook on Microsoft Teams

Incoming Webhooks allow you to send messages from external systems directly into a Microsoft Teams channel. This guide will walk you through every step, from setting up your Teams channel to configuring your webhook and adding it to the SkyU console.

# Steps to Create an Incoming Webhook

<Steps>

### Create or Select a Channel for Alerts

1. Open Microsoft Teams.
2. Navigate to the team where you want to receive alerts.
3. Either select an existing channel or create a new one:
   - Click the **···** (More options) next to the team name.
   - Select **Add channel**.
   - Give your channel a descriptive name (e.g., `alerts` or `skyu-notifications`).
   - Set the privacy level as needed (Standard or Private).
   - Click **Add**.

<Callout type="info">
Creating a dedicated channel for alerts helps keep your notifications organized and separate from regular team conversations.

### Access Channel Settings

1. Navigate to the channel where you want to receive alerts.
2. Click the **···** (More options) next to the channel name.
3. Select **Connectors** (in older Teams) or **Manage channel** → **Connectors** (in newer Teams).

<Callout type="warning">
If you don't see the Connectors option, you may need to use the **Workflows** feature instead (see note below for New Teams).

### Add Incoming Webhook Connector

#### For Classic Teams:

1. In the Connectors page, search for **Incoming Webhook**.
2. Click **Add** or **Configure** next to Incoming Webhook.
3. Provide a name for your webhook (e.g., `SkyU Alerts`).
4. Optionally, upload a custom image to identify the webhook.
5. Click **Create**.
6. Copy the webhook URL that appears. It will look like:  
   `https://your-org.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/...`
7. Click **Done**.

#### For New Teams (Workflows):

1. Click the **···** (More options) next to the channel name.
2. Select **Workflows**.
3. Search for **Post to a channel when a webhook request is received**.
4. Click on the workflow and select **Add workflow**.
5. Choose the team and channel where you want to post messages.
6. Click **Add workflow**.
7. Copy the webhook URL provided. It will look like:  
   `https://prod-xx.region.logic.azure.com:443/workflows/...`
8. Click **Done**.

<Callout type="info">
Microsoft is transitioning from the classic Incoming Webhook connector to the Workflows feature in New Teams. Both methods work with SkyU.

### Copy and Secure the Webhook URL

1. The webhook URL will look similar to:  
   `https://your-org.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/GUID@GUID/IncomingWebhook/HASH/GUID`
2. Copy this URL and store it securely.

<Callout type="warning">
Keep this URL secure. Anyone with this link can post messages to your Teams channel.
</Callout>

---

### Test the Webhook (Optional)

You can test the webhook using a simple curl command:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Hello from SkyU!"}' YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```

If successful, you should see a message appear in your Teams channel.

**Congratulations!** You've successfully set up an Incoming Webhook for Microsoft Teams. Your alerts will now flow directly into your chosen channel, keeping your team informed and responsive. Great job!
