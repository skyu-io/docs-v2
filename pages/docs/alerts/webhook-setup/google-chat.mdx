# Create an Incoming Webhook on Google Chat

Incoming Webhooks allow you to send messages from external systems directly into a Google Chat space. This guide will walk you through every step, from setting up your Chat space to configuring your webhook and adding it to the SkyU console.

# Steps to Create an Incoming Webhook

<Steps>

### Create or Select a Space for Alerts

1. Open Google Chat (chat.google.com or via Gmail).
2. Either select an existing space or create a new one:
   - Click the **+** button next to **Spaces**.
   - Select **Create space**.
   - Give your space a descriptive name (e.g., `SkyU Alerts` or `Infrastructure Notifications`).
   - Add members if needed (optional for webhook-only spaces).
   - Click **Create**.

Creating a dedicated space for alerts helps keep your notifications organized and separate from regular conversations.

### Access Space Settings

1. Navigate to the space where you want to receive alerts.
2. Click the space name at the top to open the space menu.
3. Select **Apps & integrations** from the dropdown menu.

### Create a Webhook

1. In the **Apps & integrations** page, look for the **Webhooks** section.
2. Click **Add webhooks** or **Manage webhooks**.
3. Click **+ Add another** or **Create webhook**.
4. Provide the following details:
   - **Name:** Give your webhook a descriptive name (e.g., `SkyU Alerts`).
   - **Avatar URL (Optional):** You can provide a URL to a custom image to identify the webhook.
5. Click **Save**.

---

### Copy the Webhook URL

1. After creating the webhook, you'll see the webhook URL displayed.
2. The webhook URL will look like:  
   `https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/spaces/SPACE_ID/messages?key=KEY&token=TOKEN`
3. Click **Copy** to copy the URL to your clipboard.

<Callout type="warning">
Keep this URL secure. Anyone with this link can post messages to your Google Chat space.
</Callout>

---

### Test the Webhook (Optional)

You can test the webhook using a simple curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello from SkyU!"}' \
  YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```

If successful, you should see a message appear in your Google Chat space.

---

### Managing Webhooks

To view, edit, or delete webhooks:

1. Go to the space and click the space name.
2. Select **Apps & integrations**.
3. In the **Webhooks** section, you can:
   - View all configured webhooks
   - Edit webhook names or avatars
   - Delete webhooks you no longer need
   - Copy webhook URLs

<Callout type="info">
You can create multiple webhooks for the same space if you need different integrations or want to organize alerts by source.
