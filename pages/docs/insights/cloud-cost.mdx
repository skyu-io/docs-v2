- Enter a **name** and the **AWS Account ID** for which you want to create the report.
- Under the **Permissions** section, select **Cloud Cost Access**.

Before clicking **Create**, click the **Create Role on AWS** button. This will redirect you to the AWS CloudFormation console for the account you opened earlier.

> Deploy the provided CloudFormation stack — it will create the necessary IAM role within your AWS account.

Once the stack is successfully created, return and click the **Create** button.
